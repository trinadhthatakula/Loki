* 100% Kotlin
* Material 3 Design
* Jetpack Compose

## What does this do?
Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of your favorite apps? With Loki, you can empower the God of Mischief to uncover their secrets! Loki helps you:

*   **Initiate the Spy Work:** Select any installed app, and with a tap, unleash Loki to begin his discreet 'spy work'.
*   **Track the Trails:** Loki diligently monitors and extracts all logs from the selected application, tracking every whisper and murmur until you decide it's time for him to cease his surveillance.
*   **Save the Secrets:** Once Loki's mission is complete, all the gathered intelligence is neatly compiled and saved into a convenient text file.
*   **Share the Scoop:** Easily share the generated log file directly from within the app, letting you distribute Loki's findings with ease.

It's like giving Loki a secret mission to peek into the digital diary of your apps!

## Will this work on my device?
- I have no idea if it will, app is still in early stages of development.

## Will this project be discontinued in future?
- No, I am planning on developing this into something like app crash detector, for now it's just an app to check and export Logs for any app.

# What other features are you working on?
- Live monitor for apps
